# Depth Estimation and Object Detection for Autonomous Driving


`Project Details`
• Model Architecture & Adaptation: Identify and justify the choice of model architecture best
suited for your selected task. You may perform targeted refinements—such as hyperparameter
tuning, layer augmentation or removal, and optimizer adjustments—to optimize performance,
provided these changes are documented and justified.
• Dataset Usage: Load the dataset using the provided Google Drive path (Google Drive). For
detailed steps, refer to the Instruction.
• Submission Items: Submit a complete, executable codebase (e.g., a notebook or script) along
with all necessary artifacts—trained model weights, sample outputs (images, videos, metrics),
and any visualizations—that collectively demonstrate the end-to-end workflow and final results
of your project.


`Overview`
Vision-based autonomous driving systems perform real-time classification of vehicles, pedestrians,
cyclists, and traffic signs directly from camera feeds. High-speed convolutional neural networks
analyze each frame in milliseconds, drawing bounding boxes and assigning class labels on
the fly to support timely decision-making and collision avoidance.
